# Heap Sorting Algorithm

Welcome to the Heap Sorting Algorithm repository! This repository is dedicated to learning and understanding the Heap Sort algorithm, a popular sorting technique known for its efficiency and simplicity.

## Overview

Heap Sort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm that builds a binary heap from the elements and then repeatedly extracts the maximum (for max-heap) or minimum (for min-heap) element from the heap and rebuilds the heap until the heap is empty. It's an in-place algorithm with a time complexity of O(n log n) in its worst-case scenario.

## Repository Contents

- **heap_sort.py**: This file contains the Python implementation of the Heap Sort algorithm. It includes functions to build a max-heap, perform the heap sort, and auxiliary functions required for heap operations.

- **README.md**: You're currently reading the README file, which provides an overview of the repository, instructions, and additional information.

## Presentation for the Class

For the presentation to the class, we will cover the following topics:

1. **Introduction to Heap Sort**: We'll begin by explaining what Heap Sort is, its significance, and where it's commonly used.

2. **Understanding Binary Heaps**: We'll delve into the concept of binary heaps, explaining what they are, how they're structured, and their properties.

3. **Building a Max-Heap**: We'll walk through the process of building a max-heap from an array of elements, highlighting the key steps involved.

4. **Heap Sort Algorithm**: We'll explain the steps of the Heap Sort algorithm, including how it utilizes the max-heap property to sort the elements.

5. **Implementation**: We'll demonstrate the Python implementation of the Heap Sort algorithm, explaining each function and its role in the sorting process.

6. **Time Complexity Analysis**: We'll discuss the time complexity of Heap Sort and compare it with other sorting algorithms.

7. **Visualization**: If possible, we'll provide visual aids or animations to help visualize the heap construction and sorting process.

8. **Demonstration**: We'll run the implemented code on sample datasets to showcase its effectiveness in sorting.

9. **Conclusion**: We'll summarize the key points covered in the presentation and emphasize the importance and efficiency of the Heap Sort algorithm.

## How to Use

To use the Heap Sort implementation provided in this repository:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/heap-sort.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the repository directory:
   ```
   cd heap-sort
   ```

3. You can now use the `heap_sort.py` file in your Python environment. Import the necessary functions from `heap_sort.py` into your Python script or interactively in a Python shell.
